### Viz Critique

### Good: 
* correlation plot is an intuitive way to see the relationship between these two variables
* high data-ink ratio on chart itself, but 
	* too much data for one chart
	* everything around it on the page is distracting
	* putting specific definitions of x and y variables in pop ups is helpful
		* keeps from adding more info to chart
		* gives proper definitions
* well-labeled
* seems accessible

### Bad: 
* not simple/not focused: 
	* as it's set up by default, there are too many attributes to track at once: world region, population size, movement in the x direction, movement in the y direction, years
	* the number of variables presented obscures some patterns in the data
	* many options on the legend to keep track of
	* takeaway message is unclear
	* would be helpful to draw attention to and provide context around some key events (ex. Spanish flu, break up of USSR)
* objectivity: 
	* y-axis does not start at 0
	* x-axis increments double while y-axis increments are linear, which is difficult to interpret

### My design: While the movement in the visualization is engaging, I wish the author had done a bit more analysis and targeted the presentation of the data. I think this visualization would work best as the last in a series that includes more targeted charts that show key relationships and serve as context for this exploratory tool. Therefore, I designed some sample static charts to complement the visualization. From the original, I assumed that the key questions were: (1) how has the relationship between life expectancy and income changed over time? and (2) how does this relationship vary across countries?. I designed two sets of charts to answer these questions. In my first set of charts, I show how life expectancy, income, and their ratio have changed over time. In my second set of charts, I show the variation in income and life expectancy across countries at the beginning and end of the time period. I believe that including charts like these, and potentially others that show key relationships, would allow viewers to learn more from the exploratory visualization. I would also make a few changes to the original including setting the default to not display region or population size and starting the y-axis at 0.
