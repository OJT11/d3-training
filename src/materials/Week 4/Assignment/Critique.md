### Viz Critique Notes

### Good
-high data-ink ratio: nothing superfluous
-simple design
-accessible colors
-placing the category label on the "winner" of each category makes identifying the winner easier than it otherwise would be

### Bad
-ineffective use of the length attribute: except where there are large discrepancies, the bars are not easily comparable
-difficult to tell how the categories compare to each other for either Democrats or Republicans
-missing context:
	-no title or x-axis label on the chart
	-data labels incomplete: assuming the numbers represent percentages but this is not clear
	-what do the bars represent?
		-scores? priorities? associations?
	-did the surveyer or the respondent select the words?
	-was there a limit to how many words a respondent could select?
	-who were the respondents?
		-members of the corresponding parties? the general public?
-unclear whether the focus is the similarities/differences between the parties on these specific categories or the ranking of priorities within each party


### My design: I assumed that the goal of the original visualization was to compare how much each political party is associated with the terms in the graphic. I therefore designed a paired bar chart in order to facilitate these comparisons. This bar chart eliminates the need for specific data labels to quickly discern which party is more associated with a given term. It also enables easier comparisons across terms for a given party. I added a chart title, axis labels, and a note about the methodology of the survey to provide more context around the data.
