### Viz Critique

### Good: 
* high data-ink ratio
* complete
	* tutorial explains data and visualization in depth
	* well-labeled figures
	* pop-ups provide data labels and additional context

### Bad:
* not simple/intuitive
	* required a tutorial to interpret correctly
	* did not facilitate the discovery of patterns
	* would be helpful for the arcs to have arrows to indicate the flow of people since it differs between the target and source sections
	* does not utilize length or color as dimensions
* not focused/intentional
	* spans many years, every country, internal and external migration, sources and targets
	* seems to lack intentionality in attempting to display every possible cut of the data
	* so detailed that high level takeaways and key values about the level of migration over time and the main source and target countries for migrants are buried
	* seems more like a reference for looking up questions like "how many migrants were there from Afghanistan to Pakistan in 2009" than a visualization designed to inform the general public about migration
* not accessible
	* background text (year, total counts) and filters need more color contrast to be easily legible


### My design: I found the original visualization very difficult to follow, even after completing the tutorial, so my main objective was to simplify it. Although all of the information presented is interesting, it could be broken out into different visualizations that answer different questions. I chose to design one that answers the question "where are international migrants coming from and where are they going?". With a dataset this large, I find it helpful to have a few high level charts to provide context and a few interactive charts to explore specifics. I made simple bar charts for immigration, emigration, and net immigration for a specific year so that a user could easily assess the scale of variation across countries and see which countries are most relevant to this question. I also included a country-specific section where the user could examine the main source and target countries of migration for the selected country. Finally, I included a line chart showing the total number of migrants over time for context as to how the selected year compares. My design displays a large proportion of the data in the original visualization, but by limiting the data shown at any one time and by using bar and line charts rather than pie charts and arcs, it is simpler and more focused.
