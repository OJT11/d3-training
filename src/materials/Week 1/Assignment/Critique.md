Visualization 1:

Good:
	complete: clear, helpful labels on figure, x-axis, y-axes, and legend
		but:
			would be helpful to include units on y-axes (dollars? thousands of dollars? revenue or profit?)
	seems like an objective representation of the data
		y-axes start at 0
		totals shown rather than differences
	labeling makes it quick/easy to discern that the graphic compares sales by strategy
	high data-ink ratio
		but: 
			lines between strategies seem unnecessary
			axes and legend could be more concisely labeled (strategy below then individual numbers above)
	given that the author wants to show values by strategy and by product, it's a simple design with no extraneous data or text
	looks accessible to color blind individuals
	relies primarily on preattentive attributes (color and length)

Bad:
	would be better to use colors that are completely distinct from one another (rather than shades of each other) unless products are related
	attention is not drawn to the total line, which is probably the key element
		would be good to make the total line thicker
		it would be good to add a point on the total line at the maximum (assuming the goal is to maximize sales)
	visualization does not clearly emphasize any particular pattern or takeaway
	unclear who the audience is
	to give appropriate context, might be good to include information about baseline sales (if any)


My design: In general, I thought the original visualization was effective, so I kept many aspects the same. In the original, I'm assuming the key
	outcome was total sales and that the author wanted to show which products drove the highest sales. The major change in my mockup is that I wanted
	to draw more attention to the total. Therefore, I represented the total in thick, black bars to better illustrate the variation in the total across strategies and to make the total more of a key feature in the graph. Now it is immediately obvious which strategy produced the highest total sales.
	I also added some (presumed) detail to the y-axes and streamlined the labeling of products and strategies. Finally, I changed the colors to be as different as possible rather than shades of one another to make clear that the products are unrelated.



Visualization 2:

Good:
	high data-ink ratio: every element is data, legend, or axis
	y-axis begins at 0
	given how many numbers are on the figure, it's helpful to have the key numbers outlined
	relies primarily on preattentive attributes (color and length)

Bad:
	incomplete:
		no title and y-axis is not labeled with the unit
	not easily readable:
		percentages in yellow text
		legend (too small)
		color blind individuals might have difficulty matching some of the groups in the legend to the chart due to all of the shades
	categories on the x-axis
		it is unclear what larger group these categories belong to and why they have been selected
		the distinctions do not seem meaningful (cold vs throat)
			if, for example, cold and throat should really be one category, then the percentages are inaccurate and the figure is deceptive
	context is lacking
		it is unclear what the totals and subtotals are
			the percentages in red sum to 61.1%, which is confusing
			the percentages in blue are not equal to the number in the blue box divided by the number at the top of the column as expected
			since the colored boxes don't sum to the total at the top of each bar, it's confusing that they're stacked
			it's unclear why some percentages are negative
	visualization appears to emphasize the blue and red percentages, but the takeaway message/pattern is unclear
		if the group represented by the blue box is the important one (as perhaps the outlined percentages suggest),
			it would be good to consolidate some of the other groups into the "Others" category
	not simple:
		the figure could include either the percentages or the numbers but not both
			for example, include the total at the top of each bar and then only the percentages in each colored box


My design: Overall, I found this visualization very confusing and overly busy. Based on the fact that there are negative percentages, I'm assuming that the 		percentages represent growth over time rather than parts of a whole. Therefore, I split each bar in the original visualization into its own chart and added 	one for the total. This allows comparison of the growth rates of each bar and the growth rates among groups within each bar while simplifying the 				visualization. 	To further simplify, I decided to condense more of the groups into the "Others" category. Since the original visualization appears to 			emphasize the bright blue category (the first box in each bar) rather than the largest numeric or percentage category, I decided to showcase the first three 	 boxes in each bar and 	condense the rest into "Others"/"D". This helps make the key group of interest the focus and makes the design more accessible by having		fewer colors. Because the original highlighted the percentages rather than the numbers, I decided to simplify the figure by not including the number labels 	and draw more attention to the growth (percentages) by including a lighter bar that represents the original value and a darker bar that represents the new 		value and placing a percentage growth label above each set of bars. I also added a title and a y-axis label to each graph.



Visualization 3:

Good:
	titles on each figure, clear labels where needed
	separation of spending data into 3 plots makes each figure quite simple and easy to interpret
	there's enough variation in the annual spending and average spending per person by item data that it's easy to pick out the max and min
	seems like an objective representation of the data
	relatively high data-ink ratio
		but:
			could remove '--consumers' "treat" to sugar and costume industries', DST note, candy corn images, and tree image to simplify

Bad: 
	no average spending provided for greeting cards
	relies heavily on area as a dimension:
		differences in the average spending per person by item could be accentuated by making the circles concentric or using a different shape
	context and labels: titles could contain more information
		for all figures except the spending figure, the year
		include the geographical area in the slide title
	accessibility: fonts should be larger
	the title of the slide suggests that the figures might show how revenue in the sugar and costume industries spikes at Halloween or
		how most of the revenue spent on Halloween goes to the sugar and costume industries (no mention of decoration industry)
	the takeaway and audience of the visualization are not clear


My design: Overall, I found this visualization clear and effective. The different types of charts (bar, area) make it interesting and engaging. I didn't have 		many changes to the visualization as a whole other than increasing the font size, removing the images that don't contribute, and either shortening the title 	or including a key takeaway in the title. So I only redesigned the "Annual Spending on Halloween" chart from an area plot to a line plot (the stars represent 	 pumpkins). The main reason for this change is that showing time along the x-axis seems more intuitive. I also added the market (U.S.) to the title and used a 	   larger font.
