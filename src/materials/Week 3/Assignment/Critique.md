Viz Critique Notes

Good:
-the chart makes it easy to see the pattern of how sales vary with orders
    -the fact that sales usually but not always follow the trend in orders is clear from this graph but would be difficult to discern if the data were in separate plots
    -use of length as primary dimension
-completeness: labels are present and clear, making it easy to orient yourself to the figure
-accessibility: color contrast is clear
-relatively simple: no extraneous images or text

Bad
-medium data-ink ratio that could be improved
    -legend at the bottom does not provide any additional information
    -"2014" could be added to the title of the chart and removed from each x-axis label
    -data labels on bars seem unnecessary and are covered by the line at some points
-not an objective presentation of data
    -right y-axis does not start at 0 but at 100k, so it looks like there's much more variation in sales than in number of orders


My design: I split the original chart into two components. The first chart focuses on variation in sales across the year. The second chart focuses on the relationship between the number of orders and sales. By splitting the visualization, each graph is simpler than the original and is clearly designed around one relationship of interest. I used a bar chart instead of a line graph to show sales by month because there's not a ton of variation in sales and I wanted to start the y-axis at 0. Bars made it easier to see the differences across months. Additionally, I simplified the labeling by removing the legend, moving "2014" to the title, and removing data point labels.
