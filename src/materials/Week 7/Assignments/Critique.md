### Viz Critique

### Good: 
* map makes it very easy to see the distribution of parks and monuments throughout the city
* high data-ink ratio
	* good level of detail shown on the map
		* enough to orient yourself to the area
		* not so much that it distracts from the data being presented
* simple and focused
* faded map lines draw attention to data 
* seems like an objective representation of the data
	* although not defining the geographic scope could could be misleading as it is not clear where there's no data vs where there are no parks/monuments

### Bad: 
* incomplete:
	* lacks title
	* legend is very unclear
		* do the values represent the number of monuments? the number of visitors to monuments?
		* parks should be indicated on the legend in green
		* are the same values mapped to both a color scale and a radius scale?
* not accessible to color blind individuals

### My design: Overall, I thought the graphic itself was good, so I kept the basic design and tweaked some elements to make the context clearer. I assumed that each circle marks one monument, that the values shown in the legend represent the number of daily visitors to a monument, and that the same data is being displayed through the size of the circle and the color of the circle. I chose to keep the color of the circle as the attribute to display the number of daily visitors and would make all of the circles the same size. This would allow the circles to be a bit larger without overlapping as they currently do in the center of the map. I added a title that specifies that the data only shows parks and monuments within NYC so that the absence of parks and monuments in the surrounding area is interpreted as missing data rather than values of zero. I also changed the color of the scale so that it would not be difficult for red/green color blind individuals to discern the monuments from the parks. Additionally, I drew attention to one key value with a label and demonstrated some additional information that could be presented for each monument when the user hovers over it.
