# Viz Critique Notes

### Good:
-use of length (bar chart) and colors (map and pie charts) as primary attributes
-notes on bar chart
	-helpful for providing context for the large variations in deaths across time
	-make visualization accessible to wide audience
	-number of notes is reasonable (they document major events without cluttering up chart too much)
-data label only on largest number of fatalities
	-draws attention to the key value
	-prevents adding too much extra info
-shading on map is intuitive, with darker indicating more deaths
-high data-ink ratio
-reasonably accessible, although greater differences in shading on the map and pie chart would be helpful
-well labeled

### Bad:
-bars being upside down
	-although having the bars look like blood dripping is powerful emotionally, it's less intuitive in terms of evaluating the actual numbers
	-difficult to compare fatalies to the "US ground troops in Iraq" plot to see whether there's a correlation
-"The biggest killers"
	-use of circles makes it hard to compare the magnitudes and makes data labels necessary
	-positioning the circles along the time axis is confusing
	-circles are not ordered by number/percentage of total deaths
	-why are two circles overlapping?
-"Coalition deaths"
	-goes off the page
	-unclear whether Iraqi security forces are part of coalition or civilians
-"Coalition fatalies by area"
	-intervals on scale are very uneven such that the difference in coloring does not reflect the difference in deaths
	-data labels seem unnecessary
	-it would be better if the fatalities were pegged to the population because that most accurately reflects the "fierceness" of fighting
-the paragraph about the end of the war would make more sense at the top under the title
-the title takes up a lot of space and does not convey much information



### My design: My overall goal in redesigning this visualization was to simplify it and to make the message of each chart clearer.
As having several charts on the right of the main bar chart seemed overcrowded and distracted from the variation in deaths across time, I moved all of the supplementary charts below the main one. I removed the "US ground troops in Iraq" chart for simplicity and because it wasn't as closely tied to the death toll as the others. For the main bar chart of deaths over time, I rotated it so that the upward direction corresponds to higher deaths, which is more intuitive. I also simplified it by showing all deaths rather than deaths for two groups superimposed. I moved this information to the "Deaths by Group" graph, which shows the breakdown among the various groups and replaces the "Coalition deaths" graphic. For the "Causes of Civilian Deaths", I changed the circles to bars, reordered the categories by magnitude to make it clear which were the most important, and excluded the data labels. I showed "Deaths by Group" as a pie chart because there are very few categories that are very different in size, and it clearly shows the takeaway that most deaths were civilian. If I could edit the map, I would use fatalities per thousand population rather than the absolute number of fatalities, divide the intervals equally, and remove the data labels. I changed the visualization title to prime the viewer for the data they would be examining.
